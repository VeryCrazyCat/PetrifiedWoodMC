# Petrified Wood Mod

## Overview

This simple mod adds **petrified planks and slabs** to every wood type.

> To craft petrified wood, place cobblestone/blackstone and planks/slabs in a 2x2 checkerboard pattern, with the planks/slabs at the top-left and bottom-right.
> These blocks have a higher blast resistance and are not flammable in the same way as normal planks and slabs are, which makes them aÂ good building material.
